This is a companion app for the (FxSound-Fix Tool)[https://github.com/A-gent/FxSound-Default-Windows-Startup-Device-Fix].  This companion app locks Steam from launching until FxSound has been handled by the Tool. Have this launch with the Windows Launcher Tool, and let it start without little to no delay.
